If you changes the code here, it's going to change the behaviour of things that uses the code here.

Before doing a "git add" / "git commit" to this directory, do both of the following:

+ ASK project participants about the potential impact

+ FIND all the usages of the function/class that you changed, so as to know what code will be affected.


TODO:

+ move aleForET.py here, and change the import of its dependent files
+ move vip_contants.py here, and change the import of its dependent files
