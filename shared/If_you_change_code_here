If you changes the code here, it's going to change the behaviour of many things that use it.

Before doing a "git add" / "git commit" to this directory, do both of the following:

+ ASK project participants about the potential impact. 

+ FIND all the usages of the function/class that you changed, so as to know what code will be affected.


TODO(Ruohan):
+ move aleForET.py here, and change the import of its dependent files
+ move vip_contants.py here, and change the import of its dependent files
+ move action_enums.py here, and change the import of its dependent files
+ try to train a model to see if Python complains about any error 

These tasks can also be seen as a good way to practice and get used to the new code structure.
To start, you could take a look at the header of the new gaze/input_utils.py and modeling/input_utils.py to gain some initial familarity.

Let me do a breif Code Review before commiting the above changes. (To simplify the code review process, you can just `git add` the changed files and I will log-in to do a `git diff`)
